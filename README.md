# Rock-paper-game
Description

This project is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows the user to select either rock, paper, or scissors, and it compares the player's choice with a random choice generated by the computer. The result is displayed based on the classic rules of the game.

The game logic is implemented using the if-else statements, providing clear and understandable control flow to determine the winner.
